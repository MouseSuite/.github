This NIH-funded project is developing open-source software for the processing, analysis, and visualization of rodent brain imaging data, which will enhance the ability of neuroscience researchers to perform preclinical studies on rodent models. This software will provide advanced capabilities for analyzing multimodal imaging data, including imagery from magnetic resonance imaging and optical microscopy studies, with the goal of improving understanding of processes and mechanisms underlying neurological diseases and disorders and their potential treatment. The software will include interactive processing to facilitate ease of use, as well as command line tools to enable large scale processing for larger studies.
